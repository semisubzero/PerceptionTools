PerceptionTools is a collection of python scrips to aid in sensor calibration and basic data collection for the Ouster OS2 LiDAR and Realsense camera. If you are using VSCode, you can get a nicer looking view of these pages by right clicking and selecting "Preview"

# Introduction

The intention of this repository is to provide a basic set of tools to begin data collection with camera, lidar, gps, and IMU. Data collection is done via the respective evaluation softwares for the devices.

Intel realsense D455    -   Realsense-Viewer  
Ouster OS2 128          -   Ouster SDK  
UBLOX7 GPS              -   U-Center or Python script  
IMU                     -   Ouster SDK / Realsense-Viewer
