# Introduction

Power consumption can be measured via hardware or software on most jetson devices via the Nvidia power manager. Measuring power via hardware will have the most accurate measurements.

### Process



### Theoretical consumption

These values were taken from the datasheets or power adapter outputs of the devices.

| Device                        | Type  | Consumption   |
|-------------------------------|-------|------------   |
| Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier H01  | <30w  |   <30w        |
| Cepton Vista P60              | 10w   |
